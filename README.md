 Project Overview

TThis project successfully developed a deep learning model that can accurately detect and classify human emotions from facial images. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the system was trained to recognize seven distinct emotions based on facial expressions. The final application allows users to upload facial images and receive real-time emotion detection results, demonstrating potential applications in fields like human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and surveillance systems

 Problem Statement
Accurately recognizing human emotions is critical for applications such as automated customer service, surveillance systems, and assistive technology for individuals with communication challenges. Traditional methods of emotion detection are often rule-based or heuristic, limiting their accuracy and generalizability. This project leverages deep learning to improve accuracy and adaptability in recognizing a wide range of human emotions directly from raw image data.

 Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project were:

Develop a Deep Learning Model: Build a CNN capable of recognizing human emotions based on facial expressions.

Achieved: A CNN was developed and trained successfully.
Train and Validate on the FER-2013 Dataset: Train the model on facial expression data and evaluate its performance.

Achieved: The FER-2013 dataset was used to train and validate the model.
Explore Techniques for Improvement: Apply data augmentation and transfer learning to enhance model performance.

Partially Achieved: Data augmentation and transfer learning were discussed but not implemented.
Deploy the Model: Create an application for real-time emotion classification.
Achieved: A Flask-based application was deployed for real-time emotion detection.

 Scope

The project will focus on classifying the following seven emotions:
1. Angry
2. Disgust
3. Fear
4. Happy
5. Neutral
6. Sad
7. Surprise


The scope of the project includes:
 Data collection and preprocessing.
 Building and training a CNN-based deep learning model.
 Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance.
 Exploring techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning for improvement.
 Deploying the model in a simple web or desktop application.

 Project Deliverables

By the end of the project, the following deliverables will be completed:
1. A trained CNN model for facial emotion detection, capable of classifying seven emotions.
2. Model evaluation results, including training and validation accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
3. An exploratory data analysis report, detailing the dataset characteristics and insights.
4. A final project report, summarizing the methodology, experiments, results, and future work.

 Methodology

Methodology
The project followed a structured methodology:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Dataset: The FER-2013 dataset with 48x48 grayscale facial images was used.
Preprocessing: Images were normalized, resized, and split into training, validation, and test sets.
Model Development:

Architecture: A CNN with multiple convolutional, max-pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers was implemented.
Training: The model was trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer over 30 epochs.
Model Evaluation:

Metrics: Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on the test set.
Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix was plotted to analyze performance across different emotions.
Deployment:

The trained model was deployed in a Flask application where users can upload facial images and get real-time emotion predictions.
